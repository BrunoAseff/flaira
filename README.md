# Flaira

This is a **flight search platform**, where users can search and get real-time flight information.

⚙️ **Overengineered on purpose** — I'm using this project to learn DevOps, AWS, backend, and infrastructure. Expect way more complexity than necessary.

## What will it do in the future

- Search and list flight data.
- Show flights on a real-time map (using Flight Radar API).
- User accounts for saving searches.
